# bayesian-machine-learning
### A series of machine learning projects completed in a Master's level machine learning class in Fall 2025.

Machine learning of structural relationships among variables from empirical data. Decision theory, Bayesian methods. Classification: naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines(SVM), boosting. Regression: least squares, regularization methods, logistic regression. Clustering using k-means and EM algorithms. Model selection: bias-variance tradeoff, cross-validation, over-fitting. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods including PCA, ICA, MDS. Kernel methods. Other topics may be covered as time permits.
