# Bayesian Machine Learning
### Projects completed in ECE-474 Bayesian Machine Learning (Fall 2025).

Machine learning of structural relationships among variables from empirical data.
- Decision theory, Bayesian methods, Conjugate priors.
- Classification: naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines(SVM), boosting.
- Regression: least squares, regularization methods, logistic regression.
- Clustering using k-means and EM algorithms.
- Model selection: bias-variance tradeoff, cross-validation, over-fitting.
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods including PCA, ICA, MDS.
- Kernel methods and Gaussian process regression.
- Sampling methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo.
